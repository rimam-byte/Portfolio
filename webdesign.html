        <p class='text'>This page is about everything we’ve learnt in the topic ‘Web Design’ which was taught in the 
          second term.
        The learning included designing websites through the use of wireframes, Figma mockups, and experimenting with 
        different layouts.
        According to the internet, web design is the process of planning and arranging content online with a focus on 
        aesthetics and usability.
        We also explored how to apply color schemes, typography, and consistent design elements to make our projects 
        look professional and visually appealing.</p>

        <h1 class='shape'>Assessment:</h1>
        <p class='text style'>The Web Design assessment required us to choose a blog topic and research it before 
          starting the design process. We first created multiple wireframes in Figma to explore different layout ideas.
          After receiving feedback, we refined our designs and decided on one mockup to develop further. We then 
          created a detailed website mockup, applying design principles such as color schemes, typography, and layout 
          balance. I also tried to incorporate some of Nielsen’s usability heuristics into my design so the final 
          mockup was both visually appealing and easy to use.</p>

      <p class='text style'>These three images represent the main ideas we explored in Web Design. The first shows 
        the five visual-design
        principles in UX — contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity, and balance — which guide how layouts are 
        structured. The second highlights wireframing conventions, where websites are sketched as simple blueprints to
        plan placement of content and test usability before adding full design details. The third image is the colour 
        wheel, which helps designers choose effective and professional colour schemes by showing how different colours 
        work together to create harmony, contrast, and mood.</p>

      <p class='text'>These wireframes were carefully designed in Figma to plan the layout and structure of the website 
        before development. Each wireframe represents a different page or section, showing the placement of key 
        elements such as headers, navigation, content areas, and buttons. The focus during this stage was on usability 
        and clarity, ensuring that the user experience is intuitive and visually balanced. By creating these wireframes,
        I was able to experiment with spacing, hierarchy, and alignment, which helped streamline the design process and
        guide the development of a cohesive, user-friendly website.</p>

          <p class=' writing'>The mood board for this project went through several iterations, exploring different 
            color schemes, 
            textures, and visual styles. After experimenting with four variations, I ultimately chose the version 
            displayed on the left, as it best captured the aesthetic and tone I wanted for the website. Mood boards 
            are an essential part of the design process because they help define the visual language, guide creative 
            decisions, and ensure consistency across all elements. By curating colors, typography, and imagery, a mood 
            board acts as a reference point that communicates the intended feeling and style before moving into 
            detailed design and development.</p>
