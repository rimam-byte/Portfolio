                Rumaysa Imam</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my Digital Technology portfolio. 
                The purpose of this website is to showcase the work I have completed throughout Year 11 Digital 
                  Technology. 
                This portfolio highlights my skills in Python programming, usability principles, and web design.  
                This website is aimed at my friends, family, and students who may be interested in learning more 
                about the 11DT course at Mount Albert Grammar School. 
                It is also a way for me to reflect on my progress and share my growth in digital technology.  </p>

              <h2>PYTHON</h2>
              <p>See the Python programs I created this year, from flowcharts to testing and refining code.
              I explored object-oriented programming, data handling, and problem-solving through real projects.
              Each task shows my approach to breaking down problems into smaller steps and applying logic to find 
              efficient solutions.Click to explore my projects, my journey of learning new techniques, and how I 
              refined my code to make it cleaner, faster, and easier to understand.</p>

              <h2>USABILITY</h2>
              <p>Learn how I applied usability principles and heuristics to evaluate and improve designs.
              I carried out tests with peers, collected feedback, and used heuristics such as consistency, visibility,
              and error prevention to guide improvements. My focus was on making interfaces not only visually 
              appealing but also intuitive, simple, and enjoyable for users.Click to view my research, the insights I 
              gathered, and the detailed results that show how small design changes made a big difference.</p>

              <h2>WEB DESIGN</h2>
              <p>Explore the web design mockups I created in Figma and how I refined them based on feedback.
              From wireframes to polished interfaces, I experimented with layouts, typography, and color to achieve a 
              balance of usability and creativity. I iterated on multiple versions, learning how real feedback can 
              shape better designs and bring clarity to user needs. Click to see my design process, the progression 
              of ideas, and the final solutions I developed.</p>
