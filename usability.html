      <p class='text'> This page is about everything we’ve learnt in the topic ‘Usability’ which was taught in the 
        second term. The learning included a non-credited test that was conducted towards the end. According to the 
        internet the degree to which something is able or fit to be used is called usability. Jacob Neilson introduced 
        the ten usability heuristics for websites so that it makes them easier to use.</p>

        <p class='text style'>Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics are a set of guiding principles used in user
          interface and user 
          experience design to make systems easier, clearer, and more efficient to use. They focus on improving 
          interaction between people and technology by ensuring that systems are consistent, predictable, and 
          user-friendly. For example, the heuristics emphasize visibility of system status, preventing errors, 
          offering clear feedback, and matching digital systems with real-world concepts that users already understand. 
          By following these heuristics, designers can create websites and applications that are not only functional 
          but also intuitive, reducing user frustration and improving overall satisfaction.</p>
