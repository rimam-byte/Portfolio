      <p class='text'>This page is about everything we’ve learnt in the topic ‘Python Programming’ which was taught 
        in the second term. The learning included a credited assessment that was conducted towards the end. Python is a 
        high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, known for its clear syntax and readability. 
        It is widely used for tasks such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation, 
        making it one of the most versatile and beginner-friendly languages to learn.</p>

              This activity was one of the programming tasks we completed to strengthen our
              Python skills. We were required to build a grade tracker that allows a teacher
              to add grades for different students, as well as retrieve and display the grade
              for any student. Through this task, we practiced using variables, dictionaries,
              loops, and functions to manage data effectively.

          <div class="task-text">
            <p>
              In completing the grade tracker, we learned the importance of breaking a problem
              into smaller steps. First, we designed a way to store student names and grades
              using a Python dictionary; then we wrote functions to add/update/view grades and
              tested the program with sample inputs to ensure it handled errors and worked correctly.

              Another activity we completed in Python was a choice-based programming task,
              where we had to select one project out of three options: Grocery Store,
              Adventure Game, or Calculator. Each option challenged us to apply the core
              concepts we had been learning, such as variables, loops, functions, and
              conditional statements, in different ways. This task encouraged creativity
              because it gave us the freedom to pick a project that matched our interests
              while still practicing important problem-solving and programming skills.

          </div>

          <div class="task-text color">
            <p>
              Through this activity, we also learned how the same coding techniques can
              be applied to very different problems. For example, the Grocery Store task
              focused on handling user input and managing data, the Adventure Game
              required storytelling and branching paths, and the Calculator involved
              implementing mathematical operations. This showed us how flexible Python is
              and how the same skills can be used in both practical and fun projects.

      <p class='para'>This Level 1 Digital Technologies internal assessment asks students to design and build a 
        text-based quiz using Python. You will need to demonstrate your ability to plan, create, and refine a program, 
        showing clear evidence of computational thinking and debugging throughout the process. The assessment is 
        based on Achievement Standard AS92004 — Develop a computer program — which is worth 5 credits. Your work will 
        be judged not only on whether the quiz runs correctly, but also on how effectively you test and improve your 
        code.</p>

      <p class='para'>As Year 11 students at MAGS, this is our first year working towards credits, and many of us have 
        found that preparing for subjects and exams can be challenging. While some students have tried using online 
        quizzes to help them revise, these often don’t match the topics we actually study. Because of this, there 
        has been a request for more relevant and reliable quizzes that cover what is taught at MAGS and can also be 
        used offline. To meet this need, your task is to design a Python program that functions as a subject-based 
        quiz. The quiz must include at least 10 questions and focus on at least one subject area, such as English, 
        Maths, or Science. Beyond these requirements, you are free to add your own features through planning and design
        to make the quiz more engaging and effective for revision.</p>
